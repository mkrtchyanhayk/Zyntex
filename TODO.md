# TODO

- [x] Investigated the project structure and identified the technologies used.
- [x] Checked the status of the Docker containers.
- [x] Checked the logs of the client and server containers.
- [x] Identified that the database was empty and that the application was not displaying any message to the user.
- [x] Restored the "No posts yet. Be the first!" message in the `Feed.js` component.

# Future Improvements

- Create a seeding script to populate the database with initial data.
- Improve the error handling in the client to display more informative messages to the user.
- Add end-to-end tests to prevent similar issues in the future.
